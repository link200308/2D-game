# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{This game I have made is a simple platforming game. It is still not fully developed to what I wanted, but the basic idea is there are rupees the player can collect along the way, jump on platforms to reach the end of the level, and move on to other levels. The player can use up,down,left or right keys to move, or even use the "wasd" to move the player around as well.}

{The purpose for making the game is to test my level of knowledge in making a game with physics, gravity, and user input to progress through the game.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
